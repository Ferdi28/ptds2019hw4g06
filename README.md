HELLO and welcome to group 6's take on estimating Pi through a Montecarlo simulation and plotting its result afterwards.
In this package you will find two functions:
1. estimate_pi() will return a list with the estimated Pi and a data frame containing the simulated points and whether they are or not in the Pi area.
2. plot.pi() which return a plot of the data frame returned by estimate_pi
